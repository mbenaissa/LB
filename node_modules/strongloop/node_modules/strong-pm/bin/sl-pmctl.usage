usage: %MAIN% [options] [command ...]

Run-time control of the process manager.

Options:
  -h,--help               Print help and exit.
  -v,--version            Print version and exit.
  -C,--control CTL        Control endpoint for process manager.

The control endpoint for the process manager is searched for if not specified,
in this order:

1. `STRONGLOOP_PM` in environment: may be a local domain path, or an HTTP URL
2. `./pmctl`: a process manager running the current working director
3. `/var/lib/strong-pm/pmctl`: a process manager installed by pm-install

An HTTP URL is mandatory for remote process managers, but can also be used on
localhost. It must specify at least the process manager's listen port, such as
`http://example.com:7654`.

Commands:
  status                  Report status, the default command.
  shutdown                Stop the process manager.
  start                   Start the current application.
  stop                    Hard stop the current application.
  soft-stop               Soft stop the current application.
  restart                 Hard stop and restart the current application with
                            new config.
  soft-restart            Soft stop and restart the current application with
                            new config.
  cluster-restart         Restart the current application cluster workers.
  set-size N              Set cluster size to N workers.
  objects-start W         Start tracking objects on worker W.
  objects-stop W          Stop tracking objects on worker W.
  cpu-start W             Start CPU profiling on ID, use cpu-stop to save
                            profile.
  cpu-stop W [NAME]       Stop CPU profiling on worker W, save as
                            `NAME.cpuprofile`.
  heap-snapshot W [NAME]  Save heap snapshot for worker W, save as
                            `NAME.heapsnapshot`.
  ls [DEPTH]              List dependencies of the current application.
  env-set K=V...          Set one or more environment variables for current
                          application and hard restart it with new environment.
  env-unset KEYS...       Unset one or more environment variables for current
                          application and hard restart it with the new
                          environment.
  env[-get] [KEYS...]     List specified environment variables. If none are
                          given, list all variables.

"Soft" stops notify workers they are being disconnected, and give them a grace
period for any existing connections to finish. "Hard" stops kill the supervisor
and its workers with `SIGTERM`.

Worker `W` is either a node cluster worker ID, or an operating system process
ID. The special worker ID `0` can be used to identify the master.

Profiling:

Object tracking is published as metrics, and requires configuration so that the
`--metrics=URL` option is passed to the runner.

CPU profiles must be loaded into Chrome Dev Tools. The NAME is optional,
profiles default to being named `node.<PID>.cpuprofile`.

Heap snapshots must be loaded into Chrome Dev Tools. The NAME is optional,
snapshots default to being named `node.<PID>.heapsnapshot`.
