service/server-service:
- name
- id

FIXME should be package.name for strong-pm, in mesh it will be set by user, and
the package.name should be in deployment info

executor:
- id
- address
- hostname (os.hostname(), could be duplicate, could be undefined) FIXME

service-instance:
- id
- service_id
- executor_id
- currentDeploymentId FIXME ?
- processes:
  - pid
  - worker ID
  - start-time
  - stop-time
  - exit signal or code
  - reason...

  (need gc, this can collect over time...)

Process hierarchies, for display of metrics, etc.:

- Future:
  - service
    - has executors which have instances (across multiple groups)
    - has groups, which have instances (across multiple executors)
         instance has processes

- Now:
  - strong-pm: 1 service, 1 group, 1 executor, 0-1 instances, multiple processes

Note: supervisor/strong-pm is basically a service-instance

what supervisor knows about metrics:

- package name (aka "app name"), goes into service.name
- hostname (if defined) goes into executor.name
- scope, maybe: appname, supervisor/worker pids and cluster IDs
- metric json, type, name, value, timestamp
  - counters:
  - timers:
  - gauges:


Metric model:
- scope should be stripped
- queryable on service and/or instance and/or process and/or executor and/or group
  - short-term: just on process (1 or all)
- queryable on timestamp
- auto-delete data based on age or size (aprox 5min worth of data, prob, TBD),
  data rate will probably be about an update/15 seconds

- NOT REQUIRED: queryable on metric name, or set of names, like 'cpu.*', 'object.*'?
- data presented as a sequence of metrics


basic categories:
- object.*: dynamic, maybe present
- ... others, strongops groups into different charts
