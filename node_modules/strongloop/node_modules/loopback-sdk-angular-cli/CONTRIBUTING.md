## Code style

We use JSHint to ensure our coding style stays consistent. You can check
the conformance by running the following command:

    $ jshint .

## Automated tests

We use Mocha for running our tests. See
[test/lb-ng.test.js](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-sdk-angular/blob/master/test/lb-ng.test.js)
for an example.

You can run the test in the usual way:

    $ npm test
